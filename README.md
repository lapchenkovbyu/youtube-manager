I'm definitely not sure if you really should investigate in this repository, but in case you want I should leave here some instructions to set it up.

**So, prerequisites:**
* Node.js and npm (designed and tested with Node.js 9.5.9 and npm 5.6.0)
* docker (optional)
* good mood (required)

#### Installation ####
* If you are running Docker, ``` docker build . -t yourtagname ``` and ```  docker run --name yourcontainername -d -p 8080:80 yourtagname```
will serve you this delicious piece of ... code at localhost:8080
* If you're to lazy to use Docker, here's a *long* way: ``` npm i ``` and ``` npm run start ```

#### Contributing ####

Why do you want to contribute to THIS????? It's just a learning repo, go find something more interesting to join!
But if for some reason you NEED this, just fork off and do whatever you need. Think about this repo as for **abandoned** one.

See you and have a nice day!
